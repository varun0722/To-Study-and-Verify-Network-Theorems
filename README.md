#  *(a) Analyze and Experimentally verify Thevenin’s theorem practically*

##  *Aim*
To verify *Thevenin’s Theorem* experimentally and theoretically for a given DC circuit.

---

##  *Objectives*
- To understand the application of Thevenin’s Theorem.  
- To measure *Thevenin voltage (VTH)*.  
- To determine *Thevenin equivalent resistance (RTH)*.  
- To calculate load current using:  
  \[
  I_L = \frac{V_{TH}}{R_{TH} + R_L}
  \]
- To compare theoretical values with practical measurements.

---

##  *Procedure*

### *STEP 1:* Adjust R1, R2, R3, RL using sliders.

---

###  *CASE 1 — Measure RTH*
1. Short power supply terminals (9–10).  
2. Connect multimeter (5–11, 6–13).  
3. Click *CHECK* → If valid → proceed.  
4. Click *ADD* to store resistance reading.  
5. Remove connections (9–10), (5–11), (6–13).

---

###  *CASE 2 — Measure VTH*
1. Connect supply (7–9, 8–10).  
2. Connect voltmeter (1–11, 2–13).  
3. Click *CHECK* → If valid → continue.  
4. Turn *POWER ON*, vary voltage.  
5. Click *ADD* to save VTH.  
6. Remove voltmeter connections.

---

###  *CASE 3 — Measure Load Current IL*
1. Connect supply (7–9, 8–10).  
2. Connect ammeter (3–11, 4–12, 13–14).  
3. Click *CHECK* → Follow CASE 2 steps until reading is saved.

---

### *Final Steps*
- Click *CALCULATE* to compute IL automatically.  
- Manually verify IL using formula → Click *VERIFY*.  
- Use *PRINT* if needed.  
- Click *RESET* to reload.
